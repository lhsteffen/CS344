# CS-344: Artificial Intelligence

This repository is a collection of labs, homework, and other resources
associated with the Calvin University course CS-344: Artificial Intelligence.
All submissions in this repository assume that both the AIMA and PAIP tool libraries are already installed on the
user's own machine. Both of these repositories were provided as course material and contain all artificial
intelligence algorithms needed to complete the labs and homework.

This repository was created by Luke Steffen (lhs3) on Febuary 2, 2020.

## Description of Labs and Homework

### Lab 01

Lab 01 is about the General Problem Solver (GPS) program created by Herbert A. Simon, J.C. Shaw, and Allen Newell
in an attempt to create a universal problem solving engine. This lab uses the Monkeys and Bananas problem and the
Blocks World problem to demonstrate the strengths and limitations of the algorithm. This lab also uses the
Sussman Anomaly to show the limitations of the GPS. The lab also asks to come up with a problem that the GPS can 
not solve.

### Lab 02

Lab 02 is about local search algorithms. This lab uses both the hill climbing and simulated annealing algorithms
to demonstrate the general idea behind local search algorithms. This lab shows the benefits and drawbacks of both
algorithms, showing how hill climbing is faster than simulated annealing, but may not find the global maxima if
local maxima are present. This lab shows how each algorithm works by using two graphs of an absolute function and
an absolute sin function.

### Lab 03

Lab 03 is about constraint satisfaction and how search algorithms using constraint satisfaction differ from
traditional search algorithms. This lab shows the difference between the DFS, AC3, Backtracing, and Min
Conflicts algorithms, showing their strengths and weaknesses by using the sudoku and n-Queens problems. Once
the differences between each type of algorithm have been established, the lab then asks to consider the
differences between constraint satisfaction and traditional search methods.

### Lab 04

Lab 04 is about joint probability systems and Bayes' Rule. This lab shows how artificial intelligence can use
statistics to determine things by thinking logically. This lab fist shows how a joint probability system would
work, showing the issues that come with joint probability tables and how unweildy they can become. The lab then
moves on to Bayes' Rule with some hand calculated probabilities. This part of the lab shows that you can calculate
probabilities with less information given by using Bayes' Rule. This part of the lab also shows some statistical
"paradoxes" regarding drug tests and cancer tests.

### Lab 05

Lab 05 is about Bayesian Networks and determining probabilities from them using less space than full joint distribution
tables. The first portion of the lab uses a Burlary/Earthquake Bayesian Network and demonstrates how the syntax is used
to get results. The second part of the lab asks to set up a new Bayesian Network using Cancer and two tests that predict
cancer. The lab then asks to calculate a few probabilities by hand and by using the code set up. The lab then asks for
an explanation as to why the probabilities seem unexpected. The third part of the lab asks to create another new Bayesian
Network and compute some probabilities in it both by hand and through the code provided. The lab again asks why some of
the probabilities may seem unexpected. The lab closes by returning to the first portion of the lab and examining the
different types of functions used to find probabilities, asking why the they give different results.

### Homework 01

Homework 01 revists the local search and CSP algorithms discussed in labs 01-03. This homework fist asks a more
philosophical question about introspection and human cognitive modelling. After this question, homework asks you
to create and formulate the Travelling Salesman Problem for the local search algorithms hill climbing and simulated
annealing to solve. Once a solution to this problem has been formulated, the homework asks you to create a scheduling
problem for constraint satisfaction search algorithms to solve.
