## Description of Labs and Homework

### Lab 01

Lab 01 is about the General Problem Solver (GPS) program created by Herbert A. Simon, J.C. Shaw, and Allen Newell
in an attempt to create a universal problem solving engine. This lab uses the Monkeys and Bananas problem and the
Blocks World problem to demonstrate the strengths and limitations of the algorithm. This lab also uses the
Sussman Anomaly to show the limitations of the GPS. The lab also asks to come up with a problem that the GPS can 
not solve.
