# CS-344: Artificial Intelligence

This repository is a collection of labs, homework, and other resources
associated with the Calvin University course CS-344: Artificial Intelligence.

This repository was created by Luke Steffen on Febuary 2, 2020.

## Description of Labs and Homework

### Lab 01

Lab 01 is about the General Problem Solver (GPS) program created by Herbert A. Simon, J.C. Shaw, and Allen Newell
in an attempt to create a universal problem solving engine. This lab uses the Monkeys and Bananas problem and the
Blocks World problem to demonstrate the strengths and limitations of the algorithm. This lab also uses the
Sussman Anomaly to show the limitations of the GPS. The lab also asks to come up with a problem that the GPS can 
not solve.

### Lab 02

Lab 02 is about local search algorithms. This lab uses both the hill climbing and simulated annealing algorithms
to demonstrate the general idea behind local search algorithms. This lab shows the benefits and drawbacks of both
algorithms, showing how hill climbing is faster than simulated annealing, but may not find the global maxima if
local maxima are present. This lab shows how each algorithm works by using two graphs of an absolute function and
an absolute sin function.
