Perceptrons are only able to solve problems that are linearly separable. A lineraly separable problem is one that, when graphed, a linear line can be drawn which separates positive answers from negative answers. XOR is not a linearly separable problem and this can be shown if the problem is graphed, which would look something like the below graph.\n",

Because of this, XOR is not considered a linearly separable problem. Because XOR is not linearly separable, it is impossible to design a network with only one layer. This means we need at least one more layer to solve the XOR problem. The deep neural network solved in class is a network of 2 layers, which is the simplest network we can create to solve a non-linear problem. Therefore, we cannot simplify the network created in class any further."
