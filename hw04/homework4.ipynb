In many ways, neural networks have already proven themselves to be useful to businesses in ways that perceptrons and expert systems never did. NNs are already used for a number of tasks in businesses today, ranging from facial recognition to data grouping to vulnerability assessment. Machine learning and nerual networks are already being used in business settings, and this is not likely to change in the future. At the rate at which AI is growing, neural networks will most likely become the new standard in many business areas, both benefiting and replacing jobs. This trend has no sign of slowing down. This makes sense because NNs have been given an advantage that no other form of AI has seen before, big data. The amount of data generated has become large enough for machine learning models to make highly accurate predictions. This phenomenon is something that older forms of AI were not able to take advantage of. Because machine learning is able to leverage the vast amounts of data being produced today, NNs will inevitably be used more frequently. However, NNs will not be a silver bullet for business.\n","\n","While NNs can be used for a number of tasks, it is not the golden solution that many people may think it is. Neural networks are able to solve many problems and allow for new possibilities for many industries, but we will not be able to solve every problem by throwing a NN at it. Some problems do not fit the machine learning model well, and some tasks are too complicated or too detail-oriented for machine learning to handle. There is a level of intelligence humans possess that makes us able to solve problems, understand nuance, and analyze issues in a way machine learning and NNs cannot. People will always be a necessary part of business, and while NNs can help solve many issues, there is a limit to what they can do."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"c45JSsuESVdx","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Question 2\n","\n","Back propagation for the XOR deep network.
