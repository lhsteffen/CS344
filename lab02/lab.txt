Exercise 2.1

	a. Both hill climbing and simulated annealing are able to solve the
	problem. Both solutions are also able to find the correct solution.

	b. Hill climbing is able to work more quickly than simulated
	annealing. This is beacuse once hill climbing has found the neighbor
	with the highest value, it stops running and returns the value it has
	found. Simulated annealing will sometimes accept a neighbor with a 
	worse value and runs based on a timer given to it.

	c. In this specific problem instance, the starting value for x will
	not matter. This is because this problem only has a global maxima,
	which is x = 15. This means that hill climbing will always find the
	true maxima. However, if there were multiple local maxima, the
	starting value for x would matter for hill climbing. Simulated
	annealing would have little to no issue with the starting x value.

	*d. Changing the delta step value would make no difference on the hill
	climbing method because it has not implemented a delta step value. 
	However, changing the delta step value for the simulated annealing 
	would make a difference. Specifically, it would change the
	probability of simulated annealing accepting or rejecting the 
	next choice.

	e. The exp_schedule() method acts as a sort of timer, simulating
	a "higher temperature." When this function is called, it will return
	a time value. This time value will be used in simulated annealing
	as a weight to help determine whether or not to accept the next
	choice, if it has a lower value than the current choice. The longer
	the timer has gone on, the less likely simulated annealing is to 
	pick the next choice if it has a lower value. This ensures that
	simulated annealing will not make any negative changes when the
	timer gets closer to running out of time.
