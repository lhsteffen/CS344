Exercise 6.1

	Information Gain = Gain(A) = B(p/(p+n)) - Remainder(A)
	
	B(p/(p+n)) = 6 / 12 = 0.5 -> 1 bit
	
	Remainder(A) = Sum[(pk + nk)/(p+n) * B(pk/(pk + nk))]
	
	Hungry -> 2 choices for attribute (yes & no)
	yes -> 7 occurances
	no -> 5 occurances
	
	yes -> 5 positive occurances & 2 negative occurances
	no -> 1 positive occurance & 4 negative occurances
	
	Gain(Hungry) = 1 - [(5+2)/(6+6) * 5/(5+2) + (1+4)/(6+6) * 1/(1+4)]
	Gain(Hungry) = 0.5 bits
	
	While this question would be better than most of the other attributes, it would
	not be better than the Patrons attribute. This is because we are looking for the
	attribute with the highest information gain to initially split our decision tree.
	While Hungry has an information gain of 0.5 bits, Patrons has an information gain
	of 0.541 bits (calculated in the book, pg. 723). Because Patrons is higher than
	Hungry, it is a better option for the initial split in the decision tree.
