Exercise 6.2

	Exercise 1: Start Clearly and Simply
		I want the machine learning model to match a person to an image of their iris.
		
	Exercise 2: Your Ideal Outcome
		My ideal outcome is to increase the security of a system by implementing an
		authentication system that uses a person's iris as their password.
		
	Exercise 3: Your Success Metrics
		My success metrics are the number of iris images correctly matched to the
		corresponding person.
		
		My key results for the success metrics are correctly identifying 50% or more
		of the iris images, thus making the recoginition system viable to use, 
		meaning a good final project score.
		
		My ML model is deemed a failure if less than 50% of iris images are not
		identified properly.
		
	Exercise 4: Your Output
		The output from my ML model will be a person/user.
		
		The output is defined as a string that identifies the person, authenticating them
		
	Exercise 5: Using the Output
		The output from the ML model will be made when a person moves their eye up to
		a camera and a picture is taken.
		
		The outcome will be used for authentication to open a lock.
		
	Exercise 6: Your Heuristics
		If I didn't use ML, I would attempt to match a new picture to a large database
		of previous pictures. This would not be a very accurate method
		
	Exercise 7a: Your Problem, Formulated as an ML Problem
		Multi-class single-label classification which predicts whether an image belongs
		to a user in the known users database.
		
	Exercise 7b: Cast Your Problem as a Simpler Problem
		Is the given image a user, true if so, false if not.
		
	Exercise 8: Design Your Data for the Model
	
	+-----------------------------+--------------------+
	|	Iris Picture (input 1)    |    Output (user)   |
	+-----------------------------+--------------------+
	|  <Iris Image 1>             |    User 1          |
	+-----------------------------+--------------------+
	|  <Iris Image 2>             |    Admin 1         |
	+-----------------------------+--------------------+
	
	Exercise 9: Where the Data Comes From
		Iris Picture: Comes from an image taken by a camera waiting for someone
			Example data comes from taking multiple images of an iris and assigning
			each picture a user.
			
	Exercise 10: Easily Obtained Inputs
		Iris Picture (only input data needed)
