Exercise 7.1:
	
	a. Solutions to exercises 1 & 2

		Exercise 1

		cities['Large area and saint name'] = (cities['Area square miles'] > 50) & cities['City name'].apply(lambda name: name.startswith('San'))
		cities

		Exercise 2

		cities.reindex([7, 3, 1, 4, 2])

	b. One would use Pandas rather than standard data manipulation techniques in NumPy because Pandas provides a more flushed out, comprehensive library for data manipulation.
	   It is easier to set up a dataframe and manipulate data with Pandas than NumPy, meaning it is a better option to use.

	c. You would want to shuffle your data when training a neural network or other machine learning algorithm. This is because when you shuffle the data, you are effectively 
	   representing the distribution of the data. Shuffling data also provides less variance, making the model more general and accurate. In terms of specific mathematics,
	   shuffling data reduces the chance the training model gets stuck in a local minima, making the model more accurate.
