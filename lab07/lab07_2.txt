Exercise 7.2:

	a. Categorical data is non-numeric data, meaning the data is categorized by strings. Categorical data is textual based data. Numeric data is data that is number based.

	b. Task 1 Solution:
	
		train_model(
			learning_rate=0.00002,
			steps=640,
			batch_size=5
		)

		Final RMSE (period 09): 166.31

	   Task 2 Solution:

		train_model(
			learning_rate=0.00002
			steps=1060
			batch_size=5,
			input_feature="population"
		)

		Final RMSE (period 09): 175.92

	c. The hyperparameters learned in this exercise were the learning rate, steps taken, and batch size. There is not standard tuning algorithm to optimize these, but there
	   are a few rules of thumb one can follow. These rules are training error should decrease, increasing the learning rate will make training error decrease faster, if the
	   training error is sporadic, decrase the learning rate, try large batch sizes and decrease until you see degredation, and run training longer if it has not converged.
