Exercise 7.3:

	a. Solution for Task 1:
		
		california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = california_housing_dataframe["total_rooms"] / california_housing_dataframe["population"]

		calibration_data = train_model(
			learning_rate=0.05,
			steps=420,
			batch_size=5,
			input_feature="rooms_per_person"
		)

		Final RMSE (period 09): 130.65

	   Solution for Task 2:

		plt.figure(figsize=(15, 6))
		plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
		plt.scatter(calibration_data["predictions"], calibration_data["targets"])

	   Solution for Task 3:

		california_housing_dataframe = california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"].apply(lambda x: min(x, 5))

	b. The purpose of synthetic features is to find out if there are relationships between data collected. In the housing example, a synthetic feature is used to see if
	   there is a relationship between total rooms and population. These features can be used to learn more about the data and make more accurate predictions.

	c. Outliers are points of data that differ greatly from the average data value. Outliers are typically considered to by 3 or more standard deviations from the mean.
	   Typically outliers are removed from the data pool in order to make a more accurate prediction.
