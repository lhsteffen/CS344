Exercise 9.1:

	a. The linear regression approach to this problem is not the most effective method for this type of problem.
	The linear regression method does not penalize false classifications strong enough when output is interpreted
	as a probability. This results in a model that is not very accurate with probabilities.
	
	b. L2 loss, which is used by linear regression, does not penalize misclassifications strongly, making the model
	adjust far more slowly than LogLoss. L2 does not strongly differentiate probabilities, and works better for models
	that are not evaluating probabilities. LogLoss, however, strongly differentiates probabilities and will penalize
	these confidence errors strongly. This in turn will lead to a model that is far more accurate with probabilities.
	
	c. Logistic regression is far more accurate than linear regression when predicting the probabilities. When
	training using linear regression, the model's RMSE tends to fluctute frequently, and the training RMSE remains
	quite far away from the validation RMSE. The logistic regression, however, becomes accurate far more quikcly, and
	the distance between the training RMSE and validation RMSE is quickly reduced. When properly trained, the logistic
	regression model fits the probabilities far better than linear regression.
