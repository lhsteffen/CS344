Exercise 10.1:

	a. I would rather use Keras than TensorFlow for building a neural network. This is because Keras' training,
	functions, and prediction seem to take a lot less lines of code compared to TensorFlow. Keras only takes a
	few lines to train and predict after the data has been prepared. TensorFlow seems to have more functionality
	and minute settings than Keras, but it takes a lot more lines of code and a greater understanding of neural
	networks. Keras seems to be a better library to use for beginners in neural networks, which is why I would
	rather use it.
	
	b. Solution to Task 1:
	
		dnn_regressor = train_nn_regression_model(
			learning_rate=0.001,
			steps=5000,
			batch_size=100,
			hidden_units=[10, 7],
			training_examples=training_examples,
			training_targets=training_targets,
			validation_examples=validation_examples,
			validation_targets=validation_targets)
			
		Final RMSE value (period 9): 102.29
		
		Solution to Task 2:
		
		test_examples = preprocess_features(california_housing_test_data)
		test_targets = preprocess_targets(california_housing_test_data)

		predict_testing_input_fn = lambda: my_input_fn(test_examples, 
											   test_targets["median_house_value"], 
                                               num_epochs=1, 
                                               shuffle=False)

		test_predictions = dnn_regressor.predict(input_fn=predict_testing_input_fn)
		test_predictions = np.array([item['predictions'][0] for item in test_predictions])

		root_mean_squared_error = math.sqrt(
			metrics.mean_squared_error(test_predictions, test_targets))

		print("Final RMSE (on test data): %0.2f" % root_mean_squared_error)
		
		Final RMSE value: 100.73
