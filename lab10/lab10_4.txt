Exercise 10.4:

	a.
		i. Cats dataset
			Shape: (150, 150, 3) 
			Size: 1000
		   Dogs dataset
			Shape: (150, 150, 3)
			Size: 1000
			
		ii. This network is very similar to the network shown in class in regards to the convolution portion of the network. Both
		networks have three rounds of 2D convolution and max pooling, reducing the size of the network. However, the dense
		interconnected part of the network differs between the class example and Google example. The class example contained three
		layers of densely connected layers, inlcuding the output layer. The Google example, however, only contains two layers,
		including the output layer.
		
		iii. One pattern that I noticed in the intermediate visualization was that the algorithm seemed to highlight points of
		interest using yellow pixels. For example, an image of a cat will be changed mostly to shades of green. Important parts
		of the cat, like its face, ears, and paws are marked with yellow pixels. This seems to be some sort of way to categorize
		cats. The Google document mentions that this is part of the network's sparsity method.
